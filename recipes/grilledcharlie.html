  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This famous dish is best known in the town/state/idk of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>
  <p>In this midwestern twist, down under, you will see that objects don't always appear closer in the mirror.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 slices of sourdough bread</li>
    <li>Pepperjack or habenero cheese slices</li>
    <li>Salami</li>
    <li>1 Egg</li>
    <li>Pepper (lots of pepper!)</li>
    <li>Peri Peri mayonaisse (or chipotle ranch works too)</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by sauteeing the onions in a frying pan of your choice. While the onions sautee, stir occasionally, season frequently, smell constantly, you should be buttering one side of both slices of bread.</li>
    <li>Toss your salami in individual pieces onto the pan. Turn frequently to prevent burning.</li>
    <li>After a few minutes, crack the egg onto the pan and cook it your way. When the egg is nearing desired consistency, slap a piece of bread down and throw your cheese on that.</li>
    <li>Start moving all of your hot ingredients <em>onto</em> the future sandwich. Squirt some Peri Peri on the top before you seal it with the second piece of bread.</li>
    <li>Cook like a grilled cheese sandwich.</li>
    <li>Enjoy it and make sure you have a few napkins to hand!</li>
  </ol>
